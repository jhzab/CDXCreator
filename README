# CDXCreator

CDXCreator is a Spark application that creates CDX files from (W)ARC files.

It expects to be run under Spark and receives two arguments: '--input' and
'--output'. The former can also be a glob. Output is written in a "CSV" format
with " " as the seperator. The output filenames are random.

The files currently **don't** have a CDX header.
